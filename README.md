# Movie Recommendation System

## Overview
This project implements a Movie Recommendation System using the MovieLens dataset. The system utilizes two main techniques: **Collaborative Filtering** and **Content-Based Filtering** to provide personalized movie recommendations to users.

## Features
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Recommends movies based on user ratings and similarities between users.
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommends movies based on the attributes of the movies, such as genres.
- **Cold Start Handling**: Provides recommendations even for new users with limited ratings by leveraging content-based filtering.
- **Dynamic Structure**: The code is organized into classes and methods for better maintainability and extensibility.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- NumPy
